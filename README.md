# coinwatcher-pwa-angular

is a small project to get familiar with the Angular ecosystem. Here i'm using [Angular 4](https://angular.io/) together with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) to create a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) to collect informations like market prices or trends of crypto currencies e.g. BitCoin or Ethereum. The [backend](https://github.com/6d68/coinwatcher-backend) is implemented with Serverless and uses AWS with DynamoDB and Lambda.

This project was bootstrapped with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).
